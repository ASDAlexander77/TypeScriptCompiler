1) Add types ThisType and ParamType<name, Type> to be able to carry names with types for functions

2) Optimization causes bug for file 03-union-type.ts

'''
	9:                                                ; preds = %0
	  %10 = tail call i64 @strlen(ptr noundef nonnull dereferenceable(1) undef)
'''
as you can see it is calling strlen with undef reference (in non "opt" mode it is all fine)
