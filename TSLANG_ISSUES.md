# tslang issues found while working on native_ts_graphics

Issues hit while porting https://github.com/ASDAlexander77/native_ts_graphics to tslang. Every repro
should be a complete file that was run (`tslang file.ts`, JIT, Windows x64), with the tslang version.

## Open

Items 1-30 (collected 2026-10-12 to pre-alpha119) are fixed or answered; their write-ups are in this
file's git history. 24-26 were fixed by #775 (regression tests
`tslang/test/tester/tests/00tslang_issues_24_26.ts` and `ref_element_layout_error.ts`): 24 (an array
literal holding `const X = 1 << n` widened to 64-bit elements: shifts and bitwise operators now give an
`s32`, as `int` is); 25 (`cond ? [1] : []` crashed when iterated: an empty array literal now takes the
other branch's array type); 26 (`Ref(x)` of a `number` was accepted for a `Ref<f32>` parameter: a
reference to a number laid out otherwise is now an error). 27 (`-mm=rc`: a template literal passed
straight to a call reached the callee with no reference behind it, so `console.log(text)` freed it
before `this.message = text` stored it): a template, and an object or literal array printed into a
string, now carry a reference of their own as `"a" + b` does, which the caller gives back after the
call. Under `-mm=own` and rc the same strings also leaked (3M template arguments: ~570 MB, now ~50 MB).
Regression test `tslang/test/tester/tests/00tslang_issue_27.ts`.
28 (a `readonly` constructor parameter without `public`, `private` or `protected` made no parameter
property, so `t.width` didn't resolve): `readonly` alone now makes a public one, as in TypeScript.
Regression test `tslang/test/tester/tests/00tslang_issue_28.ts`.
29 (a function-typed parameter of a `declare function` was a TypeScript function value, `{ ptr, ptr, ptr }`,
so `_beginthreadex(..., entry, arg, ...)` shifted `arg` and every argument after the callback): a
function declared `@cdecl` takes each function-typed parameter as a C function pointer. A function or
an arrow that captures nothing passes; a capturing arrow or a bound method passed straight to it is a
compile error ("a closure or a bound method can't be used as a plain function pointer"). Not checked
yet: a closure already stored in a variable of function type, passed on to a `@cdecl` parameter, still
loses its captures at run time. Regression tests `tslang/test/tester/tests/00tslang_issue_29.ts`,
`00tslang_issue_29_thread.ts` (Windows), `00tslang_issue_29_pthread.ts` (Linux) and
`cdecl_closure_error.ts`.
30 (a generic's body, compiled where it is first instantiated, resolved a name to a local of the
instantiating function: `const total = 5` in `main` hid the module's `total()` from `Bag<T>.sum()`, and
a local `values` broke the default library's `Array<T>`): a generic declared outside every function
now sees no local of another function; one declared in a function still reads that function's locals,
and lambdas in a generic still capture the generic's own. Regression test
`tslang/test/tester/tests/00tslang_issue_30.ts`.
Items 34-36, found in the default library on 2026-11-08, are fixed or answered too: 34 (a string
literal starting with U+FEFF lost it, so its `.length` was 0): LLVM's UTF-16 to UTF-8
conversion took a leading U+FEFF for a byte order mark and skipped it, and would have byte-swapped a
literal starting with U+FFFE. Literals are now converted as they are. 35 (`"\\n"` read as a line feed)
did not reproduce: on the same build the repro prints `2 6 4 2 2 3` and `92 2`, as expected. The repro
file was most likely written through a shell that turns `\\` into `\`, which gives exactly the output
reported. Both are covered by `tslang/test/tester/tests/00string_literal_escapes.ts`. 36 (an older
runtime on `TSLANG_LIB_PATH` failed every `--emit=dll` with a bare LNK2001 for `__tslang_heap_shared`):
tslang now checks the runtime's `TypeScriptAsyncRuntime.lib` before linking a library and says it is
older than the compiler. `-v` is an alias for `--verbose`, which prints the linker's command line, so
the linker's "use -v" hint works.

Items 31-33, `-mm=own` limits found in the default library on 2026-11-08, are fixed too, and
`thread_spawn.ts` and `atomics_wait.ts` there now run under every model. 31 (two closures couldn't
capture the same array): a closure that escapes owns what it captures, so that stays an error for a
plain object, and `Shared<T>` is the way to share one. A `const` `Shared<T>` is now captured by copy, so
any number of closures hold a counted handle each, in a loop too; under `-mm=own` a handle's count is
always atomic, since handles are what threads share. 32 (the error said `'this value'` and pointed at
the arrow): the error about a captured variable now names it, with or without `--di`, points at its
first use in the closure, and says to use a `const Shared<T>`. 33 (`this.result = this.fn()` was refused
when `R` is a class): the result of a call through a callback is the caller's when every function that
can reach the call is defined in the module and none returns a borrow of its argument. A callback that
gives back its argument or what it captured is still refused. Regression tests
`tslang/test/tester/tests/00tslang_issues_31_33.ts` and `tslang/test/tester/own/own_err_capture_*.ts`,
`own_err_callback_result_*.ts`.

Items 37 and 38, found on 2026-11-08 while trying to add JavaScript's `Symbol` to the default library:
37 (a function named `Symbol` crashed the compiler, even when nothing called it): the default library's
`[Symbol.toPrimitive]` and the like then named a member the function hasn't got, and the failed computed
name was read as if it had a value. A failed computed name is now the error it is, and see 38. 38 (a
declared `Symbol` hid the built-in one): `[Symbol.iterator]` and the other well-known names are recognized
in a computed name before `Symbol` is resolved, so a `Symbol` declared as a function or a class leaves them
working. As a value, `Symbol.iterator` stays the built-in one unless the declared `Symbol` has that member.
`typeof Symbol.iterator` gives `"symbol"`. Printing a symbol, or storing one in a variable that is used at
run time, is now a compile error that says so; it was an internal error before. A library can now declare
`Symbol`, so `Symbol("x")`, `Symbol.for`, `Symbol.keyFor`, `description` and `toString` are library work.
Regression tests `tslang/test/tester/tests/00tslang_issue_37.ts`, `00tslang_issue_38.ts`,
`symbol_value_error.ts` and `computed_name_failed_error.ts`.

Still open from 38: a symbol made at run time can't be a property key (`obj[sym]`). Fields are laid out at
compile time, so a symbol needs a run-time value and a way to look a key up. It has not been tried.

Items 39-42, `-mm=own` limits found in the default library on 2026-11-09 (TypeScriptCompilerDefaultLib
PRs #80-#85), are fixed. 39 (a chain from a new value, `JsonValue.newObject().set(...).set(...)`, could
not be returned or kept): a method whose result type is `this` returns the object it is called on, and
called on a temporary the caller owns, its result is that object, the caller's to keep. `: this` says
it, with no decorator, and implies `@lends("this")`; under `-mm=own` a body that returns another object
of the type is an error. A method typed with its class that returns `this` on every path works the same
within its module; for another module, `: this` is how a declaration says it (the `-shared` declaration
printer writes it). The default library's `set` and `push` return `this` now, and `tests/json.ts` runs
its chains under every model. 40 (an arrow that captures something could not store a closure over its
object parameter into a field of that object): it is a back-reference as it is from an arrow that
captures nothing. 41 (a closure kept in a field could not capture a parameter, and `@keeps` could not
say it did): a closure that is kept owns the parameters it captures, so the function keeps them and its
callers give them up; `@keeps("body")` is accepted. The error for a capture that still cannot move names
the variable. 42 (`[data, this.data] = [this.data, data]` did not move a class instance out of a
`T | undefined` field): an exchange of a local and a field or an element hands each value over under
every model, and `<T>data` of such a local is a view of it. Regression tests
`tslang/test/tester/own/own_chain_returns_this.ts`, `own_closure_keeps_param.ts`,
`own_swap_local_field.ts`, `own_err_this_result_other.ts` and `own_err_closure_kept_param_used.ts`.

Item 43, found on 2026-11-09 while giving the default library's `JsonValue` an indexer
(TypeScriptCompilerDefaultLib PR #86), is fixed. 43 (`bag[key] = value` on a class imported from a
library, whose indexer's `set` is `@keeps("value")`: the caller freed the value `set` kept, so it was
freed twice and the program hung at exit under `-mm=own`): the indexer's accessors of such a class are
looked up by name, and the ownership passes now take that call for a call of `set`, with its declared
`@keeps` and `@lends`. The crash of tslang.exe with `JsonValue`'s indexer was another bug, under every
model: the call made for `obj[key] = value` had no result even when `set` returns one, as `JsonValue.set`
does, so it disagreed with the function it calls and lowering to LLVM crashed now and then; it has the
setter's result now. Also, a method returning `this` that says what it keeps (`@keeps`) is no longer
told to say `@lends` too. Regression tests `tslang/test/tester/tests/import_class_keeps_indexer.ts`
(with `export_class_keeps_indexer.ts`) and `00class_indexer_set_result.ts`.

Items 44 and 45, found on 2026-11-10 in native_ts_graphics' `examples/nri/variable_shading_nri.ts`, are
fixed. 44 (`flag && a && b` of two classes in a namespace threw "Can't cast from union type"): the helpers
a cast makes from source (`___cast`, `___unbox`, `___unbox_interface`, `___check_tuple`, `___bin_op_*`,
`___union_eq_*`) are declared in the root namespace, but the one made for the cast before was erased
from the namespace of the code asking for the new one, and from the root only when that code was outside
every namespace. In a namespace the old `___cast`, made for `null | boolean | A`, stayed and was
instantiated for `null | boolean | A | B`, so a `B` reached its `throw`. The old helper is now erased from
the root namespace, where the new one is declared. 45 (`-mm=own` refused `flag && a && b` of two classes,
in a namespace or not: "borrows the result of '___cast<...>'"): the second `&&` widened `null | boolean |
A` to `null | boolean | A | B` through a `___cast` call, whose result own took for a value stored. A union
widened to one that has all its members is now a plain cast, the value keeping its tag and its bytes, as
the lowering already did for it. With that, `!this.flag && texture && descriptor` in a method of an
exported class (every class in a namespace is) was still refused, "borrows a field but is used here
after it may be released or overwritten": `___cast` tests an instance with its class's `..instanceOf`,
called through the vtable, and for a class another module may extend own took that call for one that
may destroy anything. A class's `..instanceOf` is the compiler's own, which destroys nothing, called
through the vtable as through the `.instanceOf` slot. Regression tests
`tslang/test/tester/tests/00tslang_issue_44.ts` and `00tslang_issue_45.ts`, under every model.

Item 46, found on 2026-11-10 while testing 45, is fixed. 46 (`-mm=own`: a function that returns its
union parameter, given a new object, freed it twice; the exe hung or crashed at exit, while the JIT run
passed). `function same(v: A | null): A | null { return v; }` called as `same(new A())`, and as much
with `boolean | A`, `null | boolean | A` widened to `null | boolean | A | B`, or a named object no longer
used. On v0.0-pre-alpha121 too: its exe exits with 0xC0000374 (heap corruption). A call whose result is
its argument itself (spec 78) takes a temporary over: the temporary's releases go and the result is the
caller's own. The argument here is `<A | null>new A()`, a view, and the check looked at the view's users,
which hold no release: the result was made the caller's own while the object's release stayed. The
temporary is the object behind its views now. And the object's release may be in another block of the
function (a condition after the call, `x instanceof A`, splits it): one the call leads to, where the
result is released too, counts as after it. With the result left a borrow when the object is used after
the call, `x instanceof A` of the borrowed union was refused ("borrows ... and cannot be stored"), as it
was of a field read (`const x = this.f; x instanceof A`) before: the object seen as an opaque pointer,
whose vtable is read for its class's `.instanceOf`, is a test that keeps nothing, as for an owned value.
Regression test `tslang/test/tester/tests/00tslang_issue_46.ts`, JIT and compiled, under every model.
